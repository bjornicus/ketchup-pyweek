Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Build Robots!
The robots you need to build are displayed at the top of the screen.
Random parts drop onto the conveyor - these are free.
You may purchase other needed parts from the bins at the bottom of screen - these cost $1.
When your robot is assmbled, pick it up and drop it on the chute to the right - you just made $5.
Fiish all the robot orders before time runs out!
(it's all point and click except the escape key, which takes you bakc to the menu, and the spacebarw which pauses the game (maybe) )
